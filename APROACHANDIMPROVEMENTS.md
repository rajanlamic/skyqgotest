## Approach
I followed following approach while doing this test.

1. I followed test driven developement for the new code I added. I did not actually any more test for the existing codes.
2. I tried to solve the problem.
3. I did not try to restucture the codebase, I just followed the existing structure. However there are lots of rooms to improvement in existing codebase.
4. I did not try to work on styling.


## Improvements
Following improvements could be made if I had enought time.

1. Restructure the files. e.g related action creator, components, redredux-promise-ucers, constants, api, helper utility functions etc can be grouped and placed inside one component folder.
2. Better styling
3. Split components into smaller components that follows single responsibilies principle
4. Wrire more tests to increase code coverage. I would probably use snapshot testings as well.
5. Would use redux-promise-middleware and bindActionCreators.
6. Would add more validations and error handlings.
7. Would use bootstrap and reactstrap for better form elements.

## Improvements if it was real project
Following improvements could be made if it was required to have production ready, in addition to above Improvements.

1. Would go automation if it was real project.
2. Would follow mobile first design
3. Would add react-router-dom when application grows.
4. Would implement container and presentation (smart and dumb) component priciple while creating components
5. Would use componentShouldUpdate for component performance,
plus many more.
